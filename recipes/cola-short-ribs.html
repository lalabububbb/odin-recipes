  <h1>RECIPES:</h1>
  <h2>Veal Stock:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 °F</li>
    <li>Add the bone to a roasting pan and toss them in 2-3 tablespoons of neutral oil.</li>
    <li>Roast the bones for 45 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and flip the bones. Additionally, combine the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic head in a large bowl. Toss the vegetable in another 2-3 tablespoons of oil and the tomato paste, then add them to the roasting pan in the oven.</li>
    <li>Roast the bones and vegetables for an additional 30 - 45 minutes or until the edges of the vegetables are beginning to char.</li>
    <li>Transfer the roasted bones and vegetables to a large stock pot.</li>
    <li>Deglaze the roasting pan by adding the water and wine to the pan and scraping up any remnants from the bottom using a flat wooden spatula.</li>
    <li>Add the deglazing liquid into the stock pot containing the bones and vegetables. Add just enough water to just cover the bones and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Add the thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and black peppercorns to the pot, then partially cover the pot and bring the stock to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Making sure to skim off any scum or fat that rises to the surface.</li>
    <li>Continue simmering, never boiling, the stock for 8-12 hours.</li>
    <li>Skim off the surface of fat from the stock, then strain and use the stock immediately, or cool the stock to room temperature before storing in a sealable container for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or store in the freezer  for up to 3 months.</li>
  </ol>
