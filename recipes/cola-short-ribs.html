    <h2 class="sub-heading">Veal Stock:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 °F</li>
      <li>Add the bone to a roasting pan and toss them in 2-3 tablespoons of neutral oil.</li>
      <li>Roast the bones for 45 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven and flip the bones. Additionally, combine the onion, celery, carrots, and garlic head in a large bowl. Toss the vegetable in another 2-3 tablespoons of oil and the tomato paste, then add them to the roasting pan in the oven.</li>
      <li>Roast the bones and vegetables for an additional 30 - 45 minutes or until the edges of the vegetables are beginning to char.</li>
      <li>Transfer the roasted bones and vegetables to a large stock pot.</li>
      <li>Deglaze the roasting pan by adding the water and wine to the pan and scraping up any remnants from the bottom using a flat wooden spatula.</li>
      <li>Add the deglazing liquid into the stock pot containing the bones and vegetables. Add just enough water to just cover the bones and vegetables.</li>
      <li>Add the thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and black peppercorns to the pot, then partially cover the pot and bring the stock to a bare simmer over medium-high heat. Making sure to skim off any scum or fat that rises to the surface.</li>
      <li>Continue simmering, never boiling, the stock for 8-12 hours.</li>
      <li>Skim off the surface of fat from the stock, then strain and use the stock immediately, or cool the stock to room temperature before storing in a sealable container for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or store in the freezer  for up to 3 months.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Cola-Braised Short Ribs:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 275 °F.</li>
      <li>Season the short ribs generously with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large roasting pan over medium-high heat until wisps of smoke emerge.</li>
      <li>Place the pieces of short rib into the pot and brown them on all sides. To prevent the fond from burning, place the ribs back down in the exact spot that they were before flipping.</li>
      <li>Add the onion and carrots to the pot, then cook until tender and starting to caramelize, about 7-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Deglaze the pot with the white wine, bring the wine to a simmer and cook for 1-2 minutes or until the alcohol burns off.</li>
      <li>Add the cola, thyme, parsley, bay leaves, and just enough veal stock to almost cover the beef.</li>
      <li>Place the roasting pan into the preheated oven for 3-4 hours. Halfway through roasting, flip the beef pieces. Once there is no resistance after poking with a paring knife then the short ribs are done.</li>
      <li>Remove the short ribs from the pot and place them into a sealable container. Refrigerate the short ribs overnight.</li>
      <li>Strain the remaining solids out of the braising liquid. Transfer the cooking liquid to a sealable container to refrigerate overnight.</li>
      <li>Once chilled, scoop off any solidified fat from the top of the reserved braising liquid.</li>
      <li>Transfer the braising liquid to a wide skillet. Bring the liquid to a boil and simmer until a sauce forms, thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Reheat the short ribs in the sauce, then serve with Risotto.</li>
    </ol>
