  <h1>RECIPES:</h1>
  <h2>Parmesan Shells:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Move the oven rack to the top third of the oven and preheat the oven to 400 °F. Prepare a large sheet tray with a silicone baking mat.</li>
    <li>Combine the parmesan cheese and cornstarch in a small bowl, and toss to combine.</li>
    <li>Distribute 15 grams of parmesan into a 3-inch pastry cutter placed over the silicone baking mat. Optionally, for mini shells, distribute 4 grams of parmesan cheese into a 1-inch pastry cutter. Compress the parmesan into a ¼ inch round, then carefully remove the mold. </li>
    <li>Bake the parmesan for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. </li>
    <li>Remove the rounds from the oven and let cool for 5-10 seconds, then carefully, roll the rounds around a 1-inch dowel (or a ⅓-inch dowel for mini shells). </li>
    <li>Let the parmesan shells cool for 15-20 seconds before unmolding. Let cool completely on a rack before filling.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Mortadella Cream:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the mortadella to the base of a high-powered blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat the milk to a bare simmer, then with the blender running, pour the hot milk into the blended mortadella. Continue blending for 2 minutes or until the mixture is extremely smooth.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, then place the bowl in an ice bath. Cool the mixture to room temperature, making sure to stir the mixture periodically to ensure even cooling.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, whip the heavy cream to medium peaks.</li>
    <li>Fold the cream into the cooled mortadella mixture and season with nutmeg, pepper, and salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture to a piping bag and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Shallot Oil:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the oil and shallots in a small saucepan. Heat over  medium-low heat and cook until the shallots are crispy, about 15-20 minutes</li>
    <li>Strain and set aside the oil to cool to room temperature. Reserve the crispy shallots for another use.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Olive Tapenade:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the olives (with the oil), lemon juice, capers, garlic, and anchovy filets in the base of a food processor.</li>
    <li>Pulse until the ingredients are well combined and finely chopped, but stop before the mixture becomes a paste.</li>
    <li>Season the tapenade to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Savory Cannoli:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill the Parmesan Shells with the Mortadella Cream. Dip each end of the cannoli into the chopped pistachios.</li>
    <li>Add a small mound of Olive Tapenade to the center of a serving plate of choice. Place the cannoli over the tapenade and top with the roe and a drizzle of Shallot Oil.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
