  <h1>Elevated savory cannoli</h1>
  <p>This is a recipe for a savory cannoli that appeared in Season 2 Episode 9 titled "Omelette" </p>

  <p>This is a very complicated recipe with 4 components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parmesan Shells</li>
    <li>Mortadella Cream</li>
    <li>Shallot Oil</li>
    <li>Olive Tapenade</li>
  </ul>
